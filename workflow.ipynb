The conjunction used here was the effect of the contrast [All Motion > Fixation Cross] & (logical AND) the contrast [Animate > Inanimate Motion] ‚Äì i.e. [All motion > Fixation cross & Animate ‚Äì inanimate motion]. The conjunction was performed to consider areas more active in Animate vs. Inanimate motion, but only in motion sensitive areas (activated by any type of motion).
